elemental-backend provides the core data management capabilities for the
Elemental CMS.


A notable exclusion to these capabilities is that of serving. elemental-backend
deliberately does not implement serving capabilities. It is not the place nor
desire of the elemental-backend developers to make assumptions about your needs
or impose our decisions into your solutions. In the case where you need
assumptions and decisions, the elemental-server project has plenty.
